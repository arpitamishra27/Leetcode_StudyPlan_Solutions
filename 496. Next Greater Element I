496. Next Greater Element I

The next greater element of some element x in an array is the first greater element that is to the right of x in the same array.

You are given two distinct 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, where nums1 is a subset of nums2.

For each 0 <= i < nums1.length, find the index j such that nums1[i] == nums2[j] and determine the next greater element of nums2[j] in nums2. If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is -1.

Return an array ans of length nums1.length such that ans[i] is the next greater element as described above.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
- 1 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. The next greater element is 3.
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. The next greater element is 3.
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums1.length <= nums2.length <= 1000
0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 104
All integers in nums1 and nums2 are unique.
All the integers of nums1 also appear in nums2.

class Solution:

        nums1Idx= {n:i for i,n in enumerate(nums1)}
        res=[-1]*len(nums1)
        
        stack=[]
        for i in range(len(nums2)):
            cur=nums2[i]
            while stack and cur> stack[-1]:
                val=stack.pop()
                idx=nums1Idx[val]
                res[idx]=cur
                
            if cur in nums1:
                stack.append(cur)
        return res
                
        
        '''     nums1[4,1,2]
                nums2 [2,1,3,4]
                s[2,1]  popped 1 and found the index of 1 in nums1 then inserted 3
                at that position 
                s[2] popped 2 and then found the index of 2 in nums1 then inserted 3
                Basically we are using the stack to remeber the values that are samller so                   
                that we don't have to check for them again
                
                After doing this the stack becomes empty and if the cur is in nums1 we                      
                append it to the stack or else we do nothing'''
